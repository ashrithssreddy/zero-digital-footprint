# Zero Digital Footprint
This repository is for individuals who care about controlling their online presence and safeguarding their personal boundaries in the digital age. It’s a curated guide to staying private and secure while navigating the vast, interconnected world of the internet.

## Motivation
The internet is vast and constantly evolving, but your digital presence doesn’t have to feel out of control. Managing your online privacy isn’t about hiding—it’s about being deliberate. This repository is a guide for those who want to take charge of their digital narrative by making thoughtful, selective choices about what they share and how they interact online.
With the right tools and strategies, staying private becomes less about avoidance and more about empowerment. It’s about ensuring that every part of your digital footprint reflects the choices you actively make, rather than the data you passively leave behind.
